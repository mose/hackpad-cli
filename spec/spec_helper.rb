# Warning:
# I'm not an expert tester, and on this project I wanted to try
# a super-isolation way. So each spec is testing each method and
# uses a lock of stubbing and doubles. Up to now I find it quite
# convenient because it makes the interdependencies more obvious,
# and when something changes in the code the need for changes in
# the stubbing is an occasion to think about the whole architecture.
# Also, it doesn't lie about the coverage, by stubbing all things,
# a thing is not covered if not explicitely tested.
